          <h3><i>A guide to signing PGP keys and using keyservers</i></h3>
          <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This guide attempts to explain the purpose and process of keysigning and using keyservers to distribute public keys. If you do not already have a PGP key, please refer to Part II of our <a href="?page=1.1">Email Encryption guide</a> to get started.</p>

          <p><strong>Software:</strong> The following software is used in this guide:</p>

          <h2>Nutshell</h2>
          <p>First, we are going to explain what a keyserver is, and talk about what keysigning is.</p>
          <p>Second, we will show how to sign keys.</p>
          <p>Third, we will show how to use a keyserver.</p>
          <p>Finally, we approach it from the other side, showing how to look up a key on a keyserver and check its signatures.</p>


          <h2>Part I: Intro to Keysigning and Keyservers</h2>
          <h3>Keyservers</h3>
          	<p>Keeping in mind that you need someone's Public Key in order to send them an encrypted message, we need an easy way to find someone's Public Key. If you want to make it easy for anyone to send you an encrypted message, it's a good idea to store a copy of your Public Key online. That's all a keyserver does; it basically stores a copy of your Public Key "in the cloud" so anyone can look up your key in much the same way that someone could look up a phone number in a phone book or directory. Keyservers have the added benefit of making it easy to see the signatures on a key. There are a number of different public keyservers, but they all typically copy each other, so it does not really matter which one you use.</p>
          	<p>We'll go through the process in detail below in Part IV, but if you want to take a peek right now, go to <a href="http://keys.gnupg.net">http://keys.gnupg.net</a> and type <em>plexiglass@riseup.net</em> in the Search String box, then press the Submit button. You should be able to see my public key. (To view the signatures, you will need to select the "verbose" option before clicking Submit.)</p>
          <h3>Keysigning</h3>
          	<p>The basic idea behind key pairs is that anything encrypted with the pair's Public Key can only be decrypted by the Private Key of the same pair. This means that it is extremely important to make sure you that encrypt your messages with the right Public Key, otherwise your intended recipient will not be able to decrypt the message. Worse than that, if some third party has the Private Key for the (wrong) Public Key you used, that third party will be able to decrypt the message instead.</p>          
            <p>So how can you be sure that the Public Key with which you are encrypting the message will allow only the intended recipient to decrypt it? The easiest way would be to physically get a copy each Public Key directly from the people you want to contact. This would virtually guarantee that you are using the right key, but it can be very impractical to get the public keys of all your contacts in this way.</p>
            <p>Since we don't want to have to go to each person directly, and sometimes we need to get keys for people we have never met, we can use a keyserver to look up the key for the person you want to contact. Alternatively, we could have that person email us their key, or if they save a copy on a webserver (<a href="/content/FE0E7924.asc">like this</a>), we could download it from there. Because we did not get the key directly from the person with these methods, we need some way to make sure it's the right key. So how do we make sure it's the right key, and that it has not been altered in transit?</p>
          	<p>This is where <strong>keysigning</strong> comes into play. Any time you get a Public Key through any indirect method you will want to check the signatures. Indirect methods include email, chat, or anything that goes across the Internet, since there is <em>some</em> chance that it could be intercepted and altered before it gets to you. Although in general this is not very likely, we want to be absolutely sure that it doesn't happen. To be sure, we can look at the signatures on the key. The signatures tell us who else trusts that key. If we know and trust some of the people who have signed the key, we can trust that the key genuinely belongs to the person it claims to. Keyservers have the advantage of showing the signatures before you even download the key.</p>
          	<p>Let's take a second to talk about what a key signature is with an analogy. Suppose Antoine and Betty are getting married. When they sign the marriage license, they have to have a witness (whom we'll call William) sign the license. When William the witness signs the document, he is giving his word that he was there and saw Antoine and Betty sign the license as well. If William is a good witness, he has also carefully checked to make sure that Antoine really is Antoine and Betty really is Betty, and that Antoine and Betty signed the very same document that he is now signing. Having the signature of a witness helps prove that the document is valid; if there is any doubt that the license was altered, one could always contact William and ask him if the document in question is the same as the one he signed. William's signature helps demonstrate the authenticity of the license.</p>
          	<p>In the same way that a witness' signature can attest to the validity of the marriage license, a <strong>key signature</strong> can attest to the validity of a Public Key. A key signature is like a statement from a witness that says, "I have verified that this key belongs to its purported owner, and it could not have possibly been modified in transit." In order for the signature to be useful to others, you should re-upload the key to the keyserver after you sign it. This is like filing the marriage license so it becomes part of public record. Now anyone can see the signature you added, and someone who trusts you can trust the key you signed.</p>
          	<p>Just like being a good witness, you should carefully check a Public Key before you sign it. Fortunately, you do not have to compare every last character of the key. Instead, you can look at the key's fingerprint. The fingerprint is mathematically determined by the key, but it is much shorter, so you can easily compare it to the known correct fingerprint. Before signing any key, you should obtain the fingerprint <em>directly</em> from your contact and check if it matches the fingerprint of the key in question. If there is <em>any difference at all</em> in the fingerprint, then you cannot trust the key in question. But be careful! It is just as dangerous to check it against a fingerprint that you did not receive directly from the contact. If someone could alter your contact's key while it travels across the Internet, they could just as easily alter the fingerprint that your contact later provides. So it is not a good idea to ask for the fingerprint through email or chat. You should verify the fingerprint in person, over the phone, or through some form of already-secure communication.</p>
          	<p>With that understanding, the basic process of keysigning is this:
          		<ol>
          			<li>Obtain a Public Key</li>
          			<li>Verify the fingerprint of the public key</li>
          			<li>Sign the Key</li>
          			<li>Upload the key to a keyserver to record your signature for others to see</li>
          		</ol>
          	</p>
          	<p>So let's see how to do it!</p>
